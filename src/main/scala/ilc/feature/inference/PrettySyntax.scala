   * The point of this implicit conversion is to trigger ambiguity errors in
   * implicit resolution, rather than failing silently and mysteriously. If you
   * see this conversion mentioned in an ambiguity error, see if you're
   * inheriting from Scalatest's Matchers or importing its members, and see if
   * you can easily stop doing that. If not, read on for the details.
   *
   * = Details =
   * This implicit conversion is usually unnecessary, because it is subsumed by
   * UTOps, even though applying UTOps is "harder" (it takes an extra implicit
   * parameter). However, ScalaTest "pimps" apply(Any) on Symbols for different
   * reasons inside org.scalatest.Matchers.
   * That implicit conversion is preferred to UTOps (which we don't want);
   * adding symbolToUTOps ensures that the ambiguity is at least detected.
   * (We could maybe ensure this version is preferred to Matchers by defining
   * this conversion inside a class inheriting from Matchers, but that seems too
   * much work and I'm not sure it'd actually work).
