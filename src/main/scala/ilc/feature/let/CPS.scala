   * properly tail-recursive transform is eta-equivalent to the basic transform.
   *
   * Theorem 1 shows that the result of their basic transform, in the version
   * for a dynamic context, is beta-eta-equivalent to Plotkin-Fischer's
   * transformation. We implement the properly tail-recursive version, but since
   * its result is eta-equivalent, the result of toCPSUntypedOnePass is
   * equivalent to Plotkin-Fischer's result. Furthermore, when starting from
   * terms in normal form, all redexes in Plotkin-Fischer's result must be
   * administrative, so normalizing this result gives a term alpha-equivalent to
   * the result of the one-pass transformation.
